## M0

M0 is a decentralized, on-chain protocol, as well as a set of off-chain standards and APIs, that allows institutional holders of high-quality collateral to issue fungible stablecoins.

## M0 Foundation Github 

M0 Foundation Github organization hosts the codebase of M0 on-chain protocol. The main projects are:
- [protocol](https://github.com/m0-foundation/protocol) - an immutable protocol that enables minting and burning of $M token.
- [ttg](https://github.com/m0-foundation/ttg) - a novel immutable governance mechanism that uses two tokens to optimize for voting participation.
- [wrapped-m-token](https://github.com/m0-foundation/wrapped-m-token) - a non-rebasing $M token wrapper that allows preserving and forwarding yield to earners.
- [m-portal](https://github.com/m0-foundation/m-portal) - a mechanism for bridging $M token to other chain using Wormhole NTT framework.
- [m-portal-lite](https://github.com/m0-foundation/m-portal-lite) - a mechanism for bridging $M token to other chain using Hyperlane framework.
- [common](https://github.com/m0-foundation/common) - a set of common contracts and libraries used across other projects.
- [solana-m](https://github.com/m0-foundation/solana-m) - Solana $M bridging portals and earner programs.
